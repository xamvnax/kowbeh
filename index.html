            <i>Hey Kowbeh,<br><br>
            Time feels like it’s slipping away since we met, and even now, during this break, it doesn’t stop moving. But I need you to know—no amount of distance or time could ever change how I feel about you. My love for you runs so deep, it could make my heart explode.<br><br>
            Hearing about Eddy broke my heart. I know how much your cats mean to you. What's important to you is important to me.<br><br>
            All I want is to stand by your side through everything, no matter what life brings. I miss you so dearly.<br><br>
            Always yours,<br>
            Amnuh ♡ </i>
